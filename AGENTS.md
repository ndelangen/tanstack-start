<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.

## Project Quick Context

- Start with [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for architecture and workflow links.
- Stack: TanStack Router/Query, Convex, Vite, and Storybook.
- Non-obvious workflow: `npm run generate` refreshes generated game data outputs.
- `bun run app:dev` uses the configured online Convex deployment. Add `--local` for the
  disposable Docker-backed environment with local test auth and a read-only copy of active
  production factions; see `docs/README.md`.

## Validation Convention

Follow the canonical validation guidance in [`docs/data-layer.md`](docs/data-layer.md):

- Convex `v` validators for boundary shape/type checks.
- Shared Zod schemas parsed in Convex handlers (`safeParse`) for authoritative semantic/business rules.
- Client-side parsing only for UX feedback.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs are tracked in GitHub Issues through the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the default triage-label vocabulary. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repository using root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
